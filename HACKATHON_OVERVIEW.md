## Problem
Climate education often feels abstract and distant. Young learners struggle to connect daily decisions to planetary impact, and accessible tools that make trade-offs tangible are rare. Many resources don’t bridge the gap between awareness and action.

## Solution: An AI-powered learning game
Save a Planet is a lightweight strategy game that turns climate systems into interactive decisions. Players start with damaging “bad systems” (Oil, Coal, Deforestation) that quickly fund growth but harm the planet, and can invest in “good systems” (Solar, Wind, Sustainable Farm, Reforestation) that protect the planet with lower income. The player balances:
- Planet Health (max 2000) — declines each second from base decay and installed systems.
- Population Health (max 100) — grows/declines based on whether resources meet needs.
- Resources — produced by systems; spent to build better systems and maintain society.

Key mechanics (per gameConfig):
- Tick: 1s. Base planet decay: 1 per second.
- Bad systems (income → impact): Oil +20 → +12, Coal +10 → +8, Deforestation +10 → +20.
- Good systems: Solar 300 cost (+8 → +6, pop≥30), Wind 450 (+12 → +4, pop≥35), Sustainable Farm 620 (+10 → +3, pop≥40), Reforestation 1000 (+2 → 0, pop≥60).
- Population needs: minimum income ≈ pop × 180 / 10 per second. Every 4s: if underfunded → −4 pop; if generously funded → +2 pop.
- Every 10s: consumption removes resources equal to pop × 4.
- Heal planet button: +10% with 15s cooldown.
- Game over when planet or population reaches 0.

Gameplay arc
1) Start: Oil, Coal, and Deforestation installed; fast income but high damage.
2) Learn: HUD and sidebars show income, required per-second resources, and planet damage.
3) Strategize: Replace/sell harmful systems, invest in long-term sustainable ones, and time the heal action.
4) Reflect: Game Over screen summarizes score (time survived + population bonus) and a narrative on your choices.

## AI Integration
This project was built with AI agents under human direction. The codebase (game loop, UI, Phaser integration, modals, HUD, balancing) was primarily generated by AI and refined by a human “director” for coherence, safety, and polish. The AI contribution is core to ideation, structure, and implementation—demonstrating AI as a force multiplier for climate education tools.

## Impact
- Sparks curiosity via immediate feedback on trade-offs (income vs. planetary harm).
- Builds understanding with readable, surfaced numbers (required income, consumption, damage).
- Empowers action: shows how replacing harmful systems with sustainable ones leads to stabilization.
- Inclusive: runs in the browser with minimal hardware, reaching classrooms and communities globally.
